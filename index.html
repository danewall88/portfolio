        <p>AMP NZ have recently seperated from their parent company AMP Australia. The most significant difference for AMP NZ in terms of this change, is that AMP Asutralia now manage the insurance aspect of the company which means AMP NZ have to redesign their digital customer facing products in order to relfect this change. MyAmp was something I worked on during my time as an intern with AMP.</p>

        <h6 class="heading">KEY LEARNINGS</h6>
        <p>The largest takeaway point that I ascertained during this project, was the importance of truly understanding the problem from a users perspective. This project taught me that design should not begin, until the business requirements and the needs of the users are truly understood, before solutions can be put forth. The end result of not adhering to my own advice, can be wasted hours having to redesign a feature or element of the app because the solution does not truly solve the original problem. </p>
       

        <h6 class="heading">FINAL DESIGN RATIONALE</h6>
        <p>The final design embeds some modern and cool imagery, which is a massive improvement on the current app. Within the app, the use of the colour blue denotes trust and security, a key brand value for AMP. Improved information architecture means the app could be developed at a lower cost and also ensured that users can complete their tasks within fewer steps in a more intutitive manner. Moreover, the app has been designed to allow for two key features to be added in the next iteration of the device.</p>

        <p>I came into this project whilst the Senior UX Designer was due to finish, in retrospect I wish I had pushed for more of a handover before I assumed the responsibilities, this would have made for more seamless design solutions and would have been more cost effective in the long run.</p>
       
        <h6 class="heading">FINAL DESIGN RATIONALE</h6>
        <p>I joined this project before the prototype was completed and sent to the development team for build. My main focus was small UI tweaks and the addition of a few UX changes. The final design, is an aesthetic, de-cluttered and highly functional means for users to view and modify their investments.</p>

        <p>Despite the time spent reviewing analytical data regarding user behaviour on this project, the conversation for the desktop approach could have been more in-depth, we spent too much of the budget fine tuning mobile and I felt the desktop facelift could have been improved.</p>
       

        <h6 class="heading">FINAL DESIGN RATIONALE</h6>
        <p>The final design included the implementation of several large scale UX additions such as a graduate calendar and improved search functionality. Moreover, a lot of focus aimed toward improving mobile view to align with the needs of users, the UI alterations were purely aesthetic and give the site a much more modern, easy to use and playful feel, a look designed to meet the brand requirements as well as the user.</p>

        <p>I entered in Robert Walters 2018 Hackathon with a group of colleagues from Yoobee School of Design. The prototype that we pitched ended up taking 1st place.

        <p>The importance of teamwork and good communication became very clear to me upon winning this comoetition. Our team communicated perfectly and worked really well together which was a huge factor in us taking out first place. I try to approach any group projects in the same manner in which I did throughout Hackathon because of this learning.</p>
       

        <h6 class="heading">FINAL DESIGN RATIONALE</h6>
        <p>The final design was a well justified and researched prototype that truly solved the problem TVNZ were facing. We highlighted during the design process that a massive challenge for streaming services such as Netflix and TVNZ VSOD is around the personalisation of mass content, there is just so much content for users to go through we chose to approach this problem and use the solution as our final deliverable.</p>

        <h6 class="heading">KEY LEARNINGS</h6>
        <p>This was my favourite project throughout my design career so far. My own design capabilities came unto their own during this project and I was granted a high level of autonomy, the final design of which was met with much praise from my peers. I love design.</p>
       

        <h6 class="heading">FINAL DESIGN RATIONALE</h6>
        <p>Bearing in mind how important large scale superannuation alliances are to AMP, we can see the value in this digital platform very clearly upon navigation through the device itself. An array of interesting and relevant data visualisation that users would otherwise not understand or generally have access to have been provided in a meaningful and engaging context. Moreover, the modular approach and the use of drop shadow and aesthetic graphs means that other companies who want their own stamp on the device should they choose to adopt it, can do so, thus truly solving the requirements of the business.</p>
